1.  If you want to convert WordNet's data-files, first
    thing you need is: WordNet!

        You can get it from:
        http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/

2.  Next thing: you have to tell wordnet2sql where to
    find WordNet. You have to create a file called

        config.py

    This file might look like:

        DICTDIR="/root/wn/dict"
        TMPDIR="/tmp"

    Use "make sampleconfig" to create this sample-config, and
    edit the config.py afterwards.

    DICTDIR is the directory, where translatewn.py expects
    to find the data.* files from WordNet.
    TMPDIR is the directory, where translatewn.py saves
    some intermediate objects, for debug purposes only!
    Just have a look at translatewn.py, to get an impression
    of what exactly that is.

3.  The above process may seem a bit complicated, but it
    isn't at all. Actually the core of wordnet2sql is
    translatewn.py, producing an SQL-File you could without
    problems run against any dbms! Try out ./translatewn.py | mysql
    if you don't believe me. The other make-targets are just
    to create the convenient .bz2 and .mysql.bz2-files you
    can find on the homepage.

These are the make-targets:

rawdata:
  makes only the "rawdata"-file.

tabs:
  makes the files in data/*.tab

mysql:
  makes the files in data.mysql/*.mysql

tabs-dist:
  makes the files in dist/*.bz2

mysql-dist:
  makes the files in dist.mysql/*.mysql.bz2

all:
  makes all of the above

clean:
  cleans up everything
